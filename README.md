# Bookmarks
### January 2014 – April 2014
###### Individual project (Advanced Web Design and Programming course). 
Coded and designed a Web application by using **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **PHP** and **MySQL**.
By creating database tables, the Web checks for the correct username and password to login. Used **PHP** to connect the database and display the bookmark table on the Website. The user is able to add, edit or delete a link and update the changes to the database. Also can create new users.

*This Web application is offline now.*
